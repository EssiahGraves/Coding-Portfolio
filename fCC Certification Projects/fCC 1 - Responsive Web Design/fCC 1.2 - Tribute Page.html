      <p id="tribute-info"><b>Here's a timeline of Raptorpeak's life:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Raptorkit was born to Embersky, a male warrior, and Talonfoot, a female scout.</li>
          <li>He lost his mother days before his apprentice ceremony after she fell over the edge of a cliff while tangled with a bird of prey.</li>
          <li>Raptorpaw became apprenticed to Shadowgasp at six moons.</li>
          <li>He lost his father at seven moons after Embersky's hunting patrol had chased prey into Meadowclan's territory, resulting in a fatal border skirmish.</li>
          <li>He continued to train under Shadowgasp, pushing himself to become a better warrior, though became more withdrawn from the rest of the clan.  This would result in Shadowgasp encouraging him to begin interacting more with the other apprentices during gatherings and meal times.</li>
          <li>His fellow apprentice, Bluepaw, went missing just before her warrior ceremony, leading a conflicted Raptorpaw to join the other apprentices in an attempt to track her against the wishes of their elders.  This led to the formation of the "'Paw Patrol."</li>
          <li>The 'Paw Patrol would descend into the underground in search of the still-missing Bluepaw, running into a nervous stranger, Maus, and a subsequent ambush of other subterranean cats.</li>
          <li>The 'Paw Patrol would awaken to find themselves bound and at the mercy of cannibals before Maus freed them and a Caveclan patrol stumbled across them.  Raptorpaw would lead the charge to rescue Rumblepaw, his biggest rival within Caveclan, lest he follow the same fate as the late Bluepaw.</li>
          <li>Raptorpaw and the others would return to the surface to be reunited with their clan, finding Caveclan sheltering in a new cave following a collapse of the old one.</li>
          <li>He helped move Caveclan's camp into the same cavern that the 'Paw Patrol had been taken prisoner in.  This decision would negatively affect him and the rest of the 'Paw Patrol.</li>
          <li>Raptorpaw reluctantly ushered Azriel, a delegate from the newly-arrived Coven, into Caveclan's camp alongside his adoptive uncle, Geckotail, following an invitation to meet with the new clowder at their Temple in the Void Lands. </li>
          <li>Raptorpeak became a warrior alongside his peers at roughly eighteen moons.</li>
          <li>He helps the other members of the 'Paw Patrol to recover from their shared trauma, and develops feelings for them.</li>
          <li>He learns from Geckotail and Dewstar that the Coven was comprised of cannibals upon their return from the Feast, and that the clans had one moon to leave their home or die.</li>
          <li>Raptorpeak and the other clan cats began to train for the upcoming battle for the Vale.</li>
          <li>He attends an emergency gathering with the other clans.  News broke of cats among them with star-given powers, and the long kept secret angered him, furthering his distrust and frustration with the high ranks and Starclan alike.</li>
          <li>He is stationed in Meadowclan following the meeting for training and heightened patroling.</li>
          <li>He reveals his decision to leave clan life after the battle to Rumbleheart, Slithercreek, and Rockyleap.  Rumbleheart attacked him and the 'Paw Patrol avoided him after informing the absent Batspark of the development.</li>
          <li>He receives news that Shadowgasp was taken and presumed dead after the Coven ambushed his mentor's patrol on Caveclan territory.</li>
          <li>He was discovered lamenting by Voidstar, leadr of Meadowclan, who encouraged him to make his peace and share his true feelings with the other 'Paw Patrol members.</li>
          <li>He encounters Rumbleheart the day before the war, and the two have a heart-to-heart before spending the rest of the day hunting and spending time together.</li>
          <li>He is positioned on the front line alongside Geckotail and the 'Paw Patrol in the war against the Coven.  He is ultimately mauled and decapitated as he sacrifices himself to save Rumbleheart from Coven member Grim. The rest of the 'Paw Patrol would rally to avenge him and slay Grim.</li>
          <li>He is laid to rest, and his feathers are distributed among the 'Paw Patrol and Geckotail.</li>
          <li>His spirit reunites with Shadowgasp, and the two reject Starclan, leaving to wander the In Between while occasionally watching over the cats they left behind.</li>
