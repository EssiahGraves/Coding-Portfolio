            <p>Here at <i>Mammoth of Mine,</i> we strive to repopulate the world with awe-inspiring creatures thought lost to time.  Following the success of similar efforts to revive creatures such as the thylacine and dodo bird, we decided that our next venture needed to be <b>BIG!</b></p>

            <h2>Real Mammoths</h2>
            <p>Our mammoths are completely genuine.  We originally genetically engineered them using only the best and most well-preserved DNA strands from paleontological finds.  Once we had successfully grown a sizable, stable population from extant surrogate elephants we decided to open up our adoption and repopulation services to the wider public!</p>

            <h2>Safe Delivery</h2>
            <p>We transport all of our mammoths through our own private fleet of dedicated delivery trailers.  Our trailers are secure and comfortable, allowing the creatures room to move, eat, and rest as they make the journey to their new homes.  We also offer fully-refrigerated transport trucks for the delivery of any frozen specimens.  All frozen mammoths arrive in their own custom-built refrigerated display units, and are installed by our team upon arrival.</p>
